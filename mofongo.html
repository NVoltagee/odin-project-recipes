    <h4 class="description">Description</h4>
    <p>
      Mofongo might not look like much, but it sure is tasty. Mashed green
      plantains with garlic, olive oil and pork rinds (or bacon). Mofongo goes
      well with chicken or fish broth and can be stuffed with garlic shrimp,
      carne frita or octopus salad. It can also be formed into small balls and
      dropped in soups or served directly in a mortar. This is one of my many
      guilty pleasures!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 green plantains, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat canola oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Mash the garlic with the olive oil in a mortar and pestle.
        Combine garlic mixture with the pork rinds in a large bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the plantain chunks until golden and crispy, but not brown, about 15
        minutes. Transfer the fried plantains into the bowl with the garlic
        mixture. Toss to coat. Mash the coated plantains with the mortar and
        pestle until smooth. Season with salt. Roll the plantain mixture into
        two large balls or several small balls before serving.
